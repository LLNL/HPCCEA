# Flux RestAPI Summer Project - HPC Academy
Khoi Nguyen, Xander Armatis
## About 
Flux is a job scheduler and research manager that is being created by developers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (https://flux-framework.org/). This repository holds the work that we did while we researched the Flux RestAPI, and tested some of its features. Some of the files in this repository are instructions for installation and demos for current and future HPC academy interns.
