# HPCCEA
High Performance Computing Cluster Engineering Academy 

Collection of tools and code for evaluation testing of HPC orchestration solutions by HPCCEA summer students within Livermore Computing. These scripts and configuration files were written by HPCCEA summer students as part of their summer internship where they explore alternative solutions to our current HPC cluster management software. Also this space includes the projects done on the clusters during the summer. These scripts/configuration files range from using configuration management tools (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Fabric, etc.) to scripting languages (Python, BASH, Perl, etc.) and configuration files or example code used in the projects. Each year, new students will be added to the project and expand on previous years work.
